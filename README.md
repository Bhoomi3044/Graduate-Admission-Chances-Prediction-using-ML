# 🎓 Graduate Admission Chances Prediction

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict the chances of a student getting admitted into a graduate program based on their academic profile.

## 📌 Objective
To build a predictive model that helps applicants and academic institutions estimate the probability of admission using input features such as GRE scores, TOEFL scores, university rating, statement of purpose (SOP), letter of recommendation (LOR), CGPA, and research experience.

---

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset used is sourced from **Kaggle** and contains the following features:
- GRE Score
- TOEFL Score
- University Rating
- SOP
- LOR
- CGPA
- Research
- Chance of Admit (target)

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models Used
- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

---

## 🧪 Model Evaluation
- Accuracy Score  
- Confusion Matrix  
- ROC-AUC Score  
- Cross-validation

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- pandas, NumPy  
- scikit-learn  
- matplotlib, seaborn

---

## 📈 Results
Achieved high accuracy across models, with Random Forest and SVM showing strong performance in predicting admission chances. The model can be further improved with hyperparameter tuning and feature engineering.
